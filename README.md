# Time-of-Tariff (ToD/ToU) Optimization Platform for Solar Renewable Energy

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a platform that optimizes energy consumption for households and businesses with solar panels based on Time-of-Use (ToU) or Time-of-Day (ToD) electricity tariffs. The platform is designed to help users maximize their savings by shifting their energy usage to periods when electricity is cheaper and using stored solar energy during peak pricing times.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Tariff Monitoring**
   - Integrates dummy utility data to fetch real-time rates and forecast TOU tariff rates.
   - Displays current and upcoming electricity prices in a user-friendly interface.

2. **Energy Consumption Analytics**
   - Monitors and analyzes the household’s or business’s energy consumption patterns.
   - Provides detailed reports on energy usage, cost, and potential savings.

3. **Smart Scheduling**
   - Automatically schedules high-energy appliances (like washing machines, dishwashers, and EV chargers) to run during low-tariff periods.
   - Integrates with smart home devices and appliances for automated control.

4. **Solar Energy Management**
   - Tracks solar energy production and usage in real-time.
   - Manages battery storage to store excess solar energy and use it during peak tariff periods.

5. **Forecasting and Recommendations**
   - Utilizes machine learning to predict future energy consumption and solar production.
   - Provides personalized recommendations for users to adjust their energy usage based on forecasted tariffs and weather conditions.
